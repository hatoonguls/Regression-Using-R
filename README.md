The study uses ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to analyse the impact of the independent variables on the dependent variable. It also conducts diagnostic tests to see whether the
assumptions of linear regression are being violated. It starts with a base model with log transformed independent variables, and then it created interaction terms to further see if the effect of independent
variables are being moderated by other independent variables. The analysis checks the significant of the independent variable drinking water.
